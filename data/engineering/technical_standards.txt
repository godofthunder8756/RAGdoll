Engineering Best Practices and Technical Standards

1. Code Quality Standards
All code must pass automated testing with minimum 80% test coverage. Code reviews are mandatory for all pull requests.

2. Architecture Guidelines
We follow microservices architecture with Docker containerization. All services must implement health checks and observability.

3. Security Requirements
- All API endpoints must implement authentication and authorization
- Input validation is required for all user inputs
- Security scans must pass before deployment
- Secrets must be stored in secure vaults, never in code

4. Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Submit pull request with clear description
4. Code review by at least 2 team members
5. Automated testing and security scans
6. Deployment to staging environment
7. Production deployment after approval

5. Technology Stack
- Backend: Python FastAPI, Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL, Redis for caching
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

6. Performance Standards
- API response times must be under 200ms for 95th percentile
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Frontend bundle size kept under 1MB
- Memory usage monitored and optimized

7. Documentation Requirements
All code must include:
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation with OpenAPI specs
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks for operational procedures
