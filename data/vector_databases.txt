Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vector data efficiently. They have become essential infrastructure for modern AI applications, particularly those involving semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture semantic meaning in a high-dimensional space. Similar items have similar vector representations, allowing for semantic similarity search.

Common Embedding Models:
- BERT: Bidirectional transformer for text understanding
- Sentence-BERT: Optimized for sentence-level embeddings
- BGE (BAAI General Embedding): Multilingual text embeddings
- OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002: Commercial embedding API
- Cohere Embed: Multilingual embedding service

Vector Database Features:

1. Similarity Search
Find vectors most similar to a query vector using metrics like:
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product

2. Indexing Algorithms
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- IVF (Inverted File Index)
- Product Quantization
- LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)

3. Scalability
Handle millions or billions of vectors with:
- Distributed architecture
- Horizontal scaling
- Memory optimization
- GPU acceleration

Popular Vector Databases:
- Pinecone: Cloud-native vector database
- Weaviate: Open-source vector search engine
- Chroma: Lightweight embedding database
- FAISS: Facebook's similarity search library
- Milvus: Open-source vector database
- Qdrant: Vector search engine

Use Cases:
- Semantic search in documents
- Product recommendations
- Image similarity search
- Chatbot knowledge retrieval
- Fraud detection
- Drug discovery

RAG Applications:
Vector databases are crucial for RAG systems, where relevant documents are retrieved based on semantic similarity to user queries, then used to generate contextually accurate responses.
