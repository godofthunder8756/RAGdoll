Python Programming Guide

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Key Features:

1. Readable Syntax
Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it easy to read and understand:
```python
if condition:
    print("This is inside the if block")
    do_something()
else:
    print("This is in the else block")
```

2. Interpreted Language
Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, making development and debugging faster.

3. Dynamic Typing
Variables in Python don't need explicit type declarations:
```python
name = "Alice"      # String
age = 30           # Integer
height = 5.6       # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```
